You may use the SDK from PHP on Windows using DOTNET() class in PHP

1) Install the DLL into the GAC (global assembly cache)

 a) Open "c:\Windows\assembly" in Windows Explorer and drag-and-drop the dll into this folder
 OR
 b) install via command line:

"%programfiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\bin\gacutil.exe" -i "Bytescout.Spreadsheet.dll"

NOTE: you may need to change %programfiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\bin\ into 
%programfiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\bin\
or into
%programfiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\bin\

If you are still getting "File not found" then run the search for gacutil.exe in "Program Files" folder to find it.

2) Now run Windows Explorer and open "C:\WINDOWS\assembly" to view installed .NET assemblies in the GAC to verify if the dll was installed into the GAC
3) Find the installed and right-click on it and select "Properties"
4) In the Properties window double-click on "Assembly Name" and copy it to your PHP code (see below)
5) In the Properties window double-click on "Public Key Token" and copy it to your PHP code (see below)
6) In the Properties window double-click on "Version" value and copy it to your PHP code (see below)

from (4), (5) and (6) you should compose the following string:

$dotnetobj = new DOTNET("ASSEMBLYNAME, Version=VERSIONVALUE, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=PUBLICKEYVALUE", 
"ASSEMBLYNAME.CLASSNAME"); 

Where 
ASSEMBLYNAME = the assembly name  (like Bytescout.Spreadsheet)
VERSIONVALUE = version value you got on step (5)
PUBLICKEYVALUE = public key value you got on step (4)
CLASSNAME = class name from the dll you want to create (for example, "Spreadsheet")

Example for Spreadsheet SDK version 2.4.0.1370:

$dotnetobj = new DOTNET("Bytescout.Spreadsheet, Version=2.4.0.1370, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=f7dd1bd9d40a50eb", 
"Bytescout.Spreadsheet.Spreadsheet");

Then you may use $dotnetobj and call its methods like this:
$dotnetobj->SomeMethod() (see the documentation of the SDK for available classes and methods and properties)
