' IMPORTANT:
' ==============================================================
'1) Add the ActiveX reference in Tools -> References
'2) Loop through the values from the Column A for which barcode has to be generated
'3) Parse the value to Bytescout Barcode Object to generate the barcode using QR Code barcode type.
'4) Save the generated Barcode Image
'5) Insert the Barcode Image in the Column B
'6) Repeat the steps 3 to 5 till the last Value in Column A
